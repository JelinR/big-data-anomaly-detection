# big-data-anomaly-detection

In this project, along with two of my peers (Kiamehr Javid, Davide Checchia), we were interested in implementing anomaly detection on a large industrial dataset (~5GB). Using the various features of Dask like task graphs and its performance dashboard, we parallelize the tasks and make analyzing big data feasible and efficient. We use an assigned Virtual Cluster consisting of 3 worker nodes for the distributed analyses. With the help of these, we managed to figure out the anomaly events and obtain the variables most correlated to the anomalies.
